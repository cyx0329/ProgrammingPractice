//Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock 
//on day i. 
//
// If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one
// and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profi
//t. 
//
// Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one. 
//
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
//Output: 5
//Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 
//6-1 = 5.
//Â             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying pric
//e.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
//Output: 0
//Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
